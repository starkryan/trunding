# Task: Simulation Test, Workflow Test, and Wallet Behavior Check

## Main Goals
- [ ] Run simulation test for the payment system
- [ ] Test the complete payment workflow
- [ ] Verify wallet behavior after successful payment
- [ ] Implement user authentication using Postgres MCP

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Project Analysis and Setup
- [ ] Analyze current project structure and payment system
- [ ] Identify key files for payment processing and wallet management
- [ ] Check existing authentication system
- [ ] Set up Postgres MCP server connection if not already configured

### 2. Simulation Test
- [ ] Create simulation test script for payment creation
- [ ] Test payment creation API endpoint (`/api/payment/create`)
- [ ] Simulate payment webhook handling (`/api/payment/webhook`)
- [ ] Test payment details retrieval (`/api/payment/details/[orderId]`)
- [ ] Test payment redirect handling (`/api/payment/redirect/[orderId]`)

### 3. Workflow Test
- [ ] Test complete user journey: signup → authentication → payment → wallet update
- [ ] Verify all API endpoints in the payment flow
- [ ] Test error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Verify database transactions and consistency

### 4. Wallet Behavior Verification
- [ ] Check wallet balance before payment
- [ ] Process successful payment
- [ ] Verify wallet balance update after payment
- [ ] Check wallet transaction history
- [ ] Verify wallet-related database entries

### 5. User Authentication with Postgres MCP
- [ ] Connect to Postgres MCP server
- [ ] Create user authentication tables if needed
- [ ] Implement authentication functions using MCP
- [ ] Test user signup/login with MCP
- [ ] Integrate authentication with payment system

### 6. Final Verification
- [ ] Run end-to-end test with authenticated user
- [ ] Verify all components work together
- [ ] Check database integrity
- [ ] Document test results and any issues found
