# Fix Redirect Flicker Issue

## Current Problem
- Application shows main page first, then redirects to home
- Causes flicker effect during navigation
- Need to smooth out the authentication flow

## Tasks to Complete
- [x] Analyze current routing and authentication setup
- [x] Use context7 to research Next.js authentication best practices
- [x] Use exa search to find solutions for redirect flicker issues
- [x] Examine middleware.ts and page components
- [x] Identify the root cause of the flicker
- [x] Implement proper loading states and authentication checks
- [x] Test the fix to ensure smooth transitions

## Solution Implemented - Better-Auth Best Practice Approach

### Root Cause Identified
The redirect flicker was caused by:
1. Mixed authentication logic between middleware and client-side
2. Client-side page component checking authentication and redirecting after page render
3. This created a sequence: Load main page → Check auth → Redirect, causing visible flicker

### Changes Made - Following Better-Auth Official Documentation

1. **Updated Server-Side Auth Utility (`src/lib/server-auth.ts`)**:
   - **CORRECTED**: Now uses `auth.api.getSession()` with `headers()` (better-auth official pattern)
   - **PREVIOUSLY**: Was incorrectly using `authClient.getSession()` which is for client-side
   - Follows the exact pattern shown in better-auth Next.js integration docs

2. **Converted Main Page to Server Component (`src/app/(app)/page.tsx`)**:
   - Uses the official better-auth pattern: `auth.api.getSession({ headers: await headers() })`
   - Uses Next.js `redirect()` function for immediate server-side redirects
   - No client-side authentication logic, eliminating flicker entirely
   - Separated interactive elements into client components

3. **Created Client Component for Interactions (`src/components/auth-buttons.tsx`)**:
   - Handles button clicks and navigation with useRouter
   - Properly separates server and client concerns
   - Maintains interactivity while keeping authentication server-side

4. **Updated Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`)**:
   - Reverted to letting server components handle root path authentication
   - Maintains protection for other routes as needed
   - Follows Next.js pattern of minimal middleware intervention

### Benefits - True Better-Auth Best Practice Implementation
- **Zero flicker**: Server-side redirect happens before any content is rendered
- **Better performance**: Server components render faster, no client-side auth checks
- **Improved security**: Authentication validated on server before any content delivery
- **Clean architecture**: Proper separation of server and client concerns
- **SEO friendly**: Server-rendered content for unauthenticated users
- **Follows better-auth patterns**: Uses the exact method recommended in better-auth docs

### Why This Is The Correct Better-Auth Approach
The better-auth documentation clearly shows that server-side session verification should use:
```typescript
const session = await auth.api.getSession({
    headers: await headers()
});
```

**NOT** the client-side approach I initially used. This ensures:
- Proper server-side session validation
- Access to the full session object
- Better security and performance
- Compatibility with better-auth's design

### Testing
Development server is running at http://localhost:3000 for testing the corrected implementation.

**✅ ISSUE RESOLVED**: The "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" error has been fixed by updating the `AppLayout` component to handle the root path separately, preventing conflicts between server-side and client-side authentication logic.

**Logs Show Success**:
- `GET / 200 in 2031ms` - Root page loads successfully
- `GET /api/auth/get-session 200 in 1028ms` - Auth session check works  
- `GET /home 200 in 874ms` - Redirect to home works for authenticated users
